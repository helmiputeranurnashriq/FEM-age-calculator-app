## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript DOM


### What I learned

This project took almost a week to complete, with one day dedicated to designing the frontend and the remaining time spent on JavaScript.
Since most of the time was spent on JavaScript, I learned many things about the concept of the JavaScript DOM. 
Learning while practicing helped me gain a better understanding of frontend development.

Which topic that covered in this projects:

- Event Handler(target)
- Input validation
- Custom HTML (Change text content)
- Write proper name/documentation
- Function


### Continued development

After reviewing my script, I realized that it did not adhere to the DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principles. There were many repetitions that could have been simplified by creating functions. However, this project was not initially planned to reach that level of complexity; its main purpose was to practice JavaScript DOM. I achieved the primary objective, and I am completely satisfied with the result.
